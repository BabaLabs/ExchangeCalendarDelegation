Feel free to use and distribute as you wish; this is by no means a perfect or fancy-looking script. It was something I threw together to
help in my work and thought someone might benefit from it.

This is meant to help automate the process of adding delegation to user mailboxes and calendars in O365. When done this scipt will 
add delegated calendar permissions from one mailbox to another.

When run it will prompt you for your O365 Admin credentials, which will then run the command to connect to Exchange Online. You will be asked
for password and MFA if applicable.

You will then get prompts for both the mailbox/calendar being shared, and the mailbox that is getting access.

After finishing the command it will prompt you to see if you'd like to do another. If 1 is selected it will return to the prompt
for the mailbox being shared. If 2 is selected the script will end.

Have fun, stay curious!
